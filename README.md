# Simple-Web-Scraper
A Web Scraper that parses through the html code of guitarcenter.com

Hello! To get this working, just run the python code using cmd, copy paste any Guitar Center link into the program and it will find the name and price of everything on that page and make a csv file of it.
This was made on Windows 10, using MySQL 8.0 and I use mysql.connector 8.0.18 to create the table in MySQL.
